  greeting: "üôè Namaste and welcome! I am your AI Monk Guide, here to share the wisdom of centuries-old monastic traditions. Whether you seek to understand Buddhist teachings, monastery etiquette, meditation practices, or the rich cultural heritage of sacred spaces, I'm here to guide you with compassion and knowledge. What aspects of monastic life would you like to explore today?",
  
  ritual: [
    "When entering a monastery, always remove your shoes and dress modestly with covered shoulders and legs. Speak in whispers, silence your devices, and maintain a respectful posture. Never point your feet toward Buddha statues or sacred objects, as this is considered deeply disrespectful in Buddhist culture.",
    "Prayer wheels contain sacred mantras and should be turned clockwise while reciting 'Om Mani Padme Hum' or other appropriate mantras. Each turn is believed to have the same spiritual benefit as reciting all the prayers written inside. The practice cultivates merit and spreads compassion.",
    "During prayer ceremonies, maintain complete silence and observe with reverence. Sit cross-legged if comfortable, or in a chair if needed. Follow the lead of monks and practitioners. If invited to participate, join in meditation or chanting mindfully. Photography is usually prohibited during ceremonies.",
    "Offering ceremonies involve presenting items like flowers, incense, butter lamps, or food to Buddhist deities or teachers. Approach with both hands, bow slightly, and make your offering with sincere intention. The merit from giving is considered more important than the value of the gift.",
    "Prostrations are full-body bows expressing humility and respect. Place hands together at your heart, then forehead, throat, and heart again before lying flat and sliding hands forward. This practice purifies negative karma and develops humility."
  ],
  
  meditation: [
    "Begin with shamatha (calm abiding) meditation: Sit with straight spine, close eyes, and focus on natural breathing. When mind wanders, gently return to breath without judgment. Start with 5-10 minutes daily, gradually increasing duration as concentration develops.",
    "The lotus position represents the Buddha's awakening, but comfort is essential. Sit on a cushion with legs crossed, or use a chair with feet flat. The key is maintaining an alert, upright posture while remaining relaxed and stable throughout the session.",
    "Vipassana (insight) meditation involves observing thoughts, emotions, and sensations without attachment. Like watching clouds pass in the sky, notice mental phenomena arising and dissolving while maintaining present-moment awareness. This develops wisdom and understanding of impermanence.",
    "Loving-kindness meditation begins with sending love to yourself: 'May I be happy, may I be peaceful.' Then extend to loved ones, neutral people, difficult people, and all beings. This practice develops compassion and dissolves anger and hatred in the heart.",
    "Walking meditation combines mindfulness with gentle movement. Walk slowly, focusing on each step, the lifting and placing of feet, and the sensations of walking. This practice brings meditation into daily activities and is excellent for restless minds."
  ],
  
  culture: [
    "Prayer flags carry sacred mantras and prayers that spread compassion through the wind. The five colors represent elements: blue (space/sky), white (air/wind), red (fire), green (water), and yellow (earth). They're hung in high places to benefit all beings touched by the wind.",
    "Monastery architecture follows sacred geometry representing the universe. The main hall (dukhang) symbolizes cosmic order, while stupas represent the enlightened mind. Mandala patterns in floor plans reflect Buddhist cosmology, with the center representing ultimate reality.",
    "Buddhist festivals like Vesak celebrate Buddha's birth, enlightenment, and parinirvana. Devotees make offerings, participate in processions, and engage in generous giving. These occasions strengthen community bonds and provide opportunities for collective merit-making and spiritual reflection.",
    "Thangka paintings are sacred Buddhist art depicting deities, teachers, and mandalas. Created by skilled artists following precise iconographic rules, they serve as meditation aids and teaching tools. The creation process itself is considered a spiritual practice requiring purification and blessing.",
    "Monastic robes represent simplicity and renunciation. The three pieces (outer robe, upper robe, and undergarment) are sewn from discarded cloth, symbolizing non-attachment to material possessions. Different traditions wear varying colors, each with specific meaning and regulations."
  ],
  
  philosophy: [
    "The Four Noble Truths form Buddhism's foundation: life contains suffering (dukkha), suffering arises from craving and attachment (samudaya), suffering can cease (nirodha), and the Eightfold Path leads to liberation (magga). Understanding these truths is essential for spiritual progress.",
    "Karma means intentional action and its consequences. Positive intentions and actions create beneficial results, while harmful intentions lead to suffering. Karma operates across lifetimes, emphasizing personal responsibility for spiritual development and ethical conduct.",
    "The Three Jewels - Buddha (teacher), Dharma (teachings), and Sangha (community) - provide refuge and guidance. Taking refuge means committing to following Buddha's example, studying his teachings, and supporting the spiritual community in our journey toward enlightenment.",
    "Emptiness (sunyata) doesn't mean nothingness, but rather the absence of inherent, independent existence. All phenomena arise through interdependence and conditions. Understanding emptiness liberates us from grasping and attachment, leading to wisdom and compassion.",
    "Bodhicitta is the compassionate intention to attain enlightenment for the benefit of all beings. This motivation transforms ordinary actions into spiritual practice and is considered the heart of the Mahayana path. Cultivating bodhicitta develops unlimited love and compassion."
  ],
  
  general: [
    "Buddhist monasticism emphasizes the Three Trainings: ethical conduct (sila), mental concentration (samadhi), and wisdom (prajna). These form the complete path to liberation, with each supporting and strengthening the others in spiritual development.",
    "The Middle Way avoids extremes of indulgence and harsh asceticism. Buddha discovered this balanced approach after years of severe practices failed to bring enlightenment. It applies to all aspects of life, encouraging moderation and wisdom in our choices.",
    "Interdependence means all phenomena arise through causes and conditions rather than existing independently. Understanding this connection between all life develops compassion and reduces ego-grasping, leading to greater harmony with the world around us."
